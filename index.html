      <p style="text-align:center;">hi here we will see the complete basics for the python </p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">if you are intrested in further python development coursers plz visite footer link </p> 
      <h3> What is Python?</h3>
      <li>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
      <h3>It is used for:</h3>

<li>web development (server-side),
<li>software development,
<li>mathematics,
<li>system scripting.<br><br>
<h3>What can Python do?</h3>
   <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
   <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
   <li>Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
   <li>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
   <li>Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
<h3>Why Python?</h3>
   <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). 
   <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
   <li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with<br> fewer lines than some other programming languages.
   <li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed<br> as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
   <li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
<h3>Good to know</h3>
   <li>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2,<br>
although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.<br>
   <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor.
   <li>It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans <br>or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.<br>
   <li>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
   <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
   <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages
 which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br>
   <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. 
Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br><br>

    <h1>Learn by examples</h1>
           <h2>below are the exact syntax fot the python operators </h2>
           <p>here you are supposed to learn and practice on the python ides</p>
            <p>the output operation in python is as</p>
           <img src=".//home page images/printfunction.png" style="width:150px;height:50px"></img>
           <p>the result for the above line of code is as</p>
           <div class="exampleimage"><img  src="../home page images/printoutput.png" ></img></div>
        
     <p>*note you can use VS CODES, PYCHARM,PYTHON IDLE ETC FOR THE ABOVE OPERATIONS</p>
